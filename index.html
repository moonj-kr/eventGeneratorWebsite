				<h1> Event Generator </h1>
				<h2 class="text-secondary text-wrap"> Project Synopsis </h2>
					<p>Lenel S2 develops innovative security technology and progressive solutions that deliver leading integrated access control. 
					To provide flexible and reliable options for their consumers, they are constantly improving existing products and features. 
					In collaboration with Lenel S2, we seek to renovate an existing tool known as EventGenerator, a part of their main product, OnGuard. 
					EventGenerator is a tool that simulates machine events for the purpose of testing and troubleshooting systems.
					The core project involves rewriting the existing functionality in C# and providing a mechanism for remote access in the form of a web application. 
					The goal is for users to be able to more easily test and troubleshoot their systems with the web application, as opposed to the already existing
					EventGenerator tool that is a part of OnGuard.
					</p>
				<h2 class="text-secondary"> Process Methodology </h2>
					<p>Our team follows the Evolutionary prototyping methodology. Evolutionary prototyping is a development method where the dev team first constructs a prototype. After receiving feedback from the customer, subsequent prototypes are produced with additional functionality or improvements. This process is repeated until a final product emerges. 
					<br></br>
					Our sponsors recommended this development method, and our team agreed that it was a good way to evolve from prototype to prototype and be able to compare each release as we complete our sprints. 
					<br></br>
					For our backlog, our team uses Trello to track our story points and tasks for every bi-weekly sprint. 
					<br></br>
					For communication purposes, our team uses Slack for development and Microsoft Teams to communicate with our sponsors. 
					<br></br>
					Our code lives on a private Github repository shared to our sponsors. We track our issues on Github as well.
