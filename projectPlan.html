		<h2>Project Plan</h2>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>The Event Generator is a tool based in C# that simulates machine events to test and troubleshoot systems through a web application. Through this tool, users can create, manage,and schedule events the generators need through the user interface. 
The existing Event Generator forces users to be at each node they want to use. Through this project, current users will be able to access the Event Generator tool through a web application without actually being on their local server. 
Our team will be meeting with our sponsors and coach weekly on Tuesdays from 6-7 PM. Besides that, the team will hold two meetings per week, separately from our sponsors and coach. These will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-6:15 PM, both days. We believe that this frequency of meetings will be enough to keep on track with our project deliverables, and enough to keep everybody updated on each other's progress. If we do have to, we can always increase the number of days or the amount of time we meet accordingly.
We plan on following the schedule below to fulfill the requirements of this project. 
(See Scheduling and Estimates)</p>
		<h3>Goals and Scope</h3>
		<p>As for our overall goals for the project, we have been provided both primary and secondary features that consumers have requested. From a high level, one of the most critical features is to centralize the control of generators from a single website. In addition to the website, LenelS2 would like a new DLL that uses C# instead of the outdated C program currently in use. Other features specify the nature of how events should be created, scheduled, and tracked.
 All primary features will be implemented by the end of the project. Secondary features will only be incorporated after all the primary features are completed and time still remains to work on implementation. Such secondary features include the ability to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>import a set of events from the database's events table as a schedule</li>
  <li>determine the status of generators on a webpage</li>
  <li>list events that will happen in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the responsibility of the requirements coordinators on our team to track and maintain the requirements document. Any changes made to the requirements must be agreed upon by both parties after the initial agreement (ex: changing a secondary feature to a primary feature.</p>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Project Website (se.rit.edu)</li>
  <li>Project Plan</li>
  <li>Domain Model</li>
  <li>Requirements Document</li>
  <li>Event Generator GUI (for testing purposes)</li>
  <li>Sequence Diagrams (general flow)</li>
  <li>Wireframes (website)</li>
  <li>Web application</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk Management</h3>
<h4>Forseeable Risks</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Estimation Flaws</li>
	<li>Requirements changing</li>
	<li>COVID-19</li>
	<li>Technical Difficulties regarding versions, software, issues</li>
	<li>Repository Conflicts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mitigation Strategies</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Multiple people keeping each other in check (what’s reasonable and what is not).</li>
	<li>Establish a clear MVP and stick to it through the duration of the project.</li>
	<li>Follow safety procedures and guidelines. If a member contracts COVID-19, depending on the severity, each member's workload can be adjusted to compensate for ill team members. </li>
	<li>Make sure development environments are consistent between team members—document all resolved issues for future reference. </li>
	<li>Maintain good repo manners. Use git control. NEVER commit to master. Pull requests must be approved by two team members. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Scheduling and Estimates</h3>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Overall Project Schedule</li>
	<li>Resouce Allocation</li>
	<p>All items on the Product Backlog will be assigned in GitHub issues, and team members will split up tasks as evenly as possible. Issues that have been completed will be closed, and any ongoing issues after each iteration will be carried over to the next. </p>
	<li>Estimation Techniques Used</li>
	<p>We will be making estimates primarily using Planning Poker, where all team members will give their estimate using story points. For each artifact being estimated, the team will go around in a circle and justify why they estimated the amount they did until a consensus is met. If a group decision is unable to be made, we will defer the estimation of that particular item until any additional information needed to clear up the disagreement is received. </p>
	<li>How Projects Will Be Tracked</li>
	<p>All project issues will be tracked using GitHub issues, including issues on the backlog, currently open issues, and closed issues.</p>
	<li>Schedule Changes</li>
	<p>Before any necessary changes are made to the schedule, all team members must agree on the justification of the changes. Once a decision is made, the team must notify all relevant stakeholders. </p>
</ol>
<h3>Measurements and Metrics</h3>
<p>Our team will be tracking the time and effort each team member has worked on the project individually, which will be aggregated for the entire team. 
To track the time and effort, our team will track the hours of work each individual team member has contributed to the project and show our accumulated effort over time throughout the project. In addition, we will track our activity through code metrics, running scans on our project for cyclomatic complexity, LOC per method, etc. to evaluate the complexity of our project.  (baseline numbers add) 
</p>
<h3>Technical Process</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Methodology</li>
	<p>For this project, we will be using the Evolutionary Prototyping development methodology. For this methodology, we will be developing incremental prototypes of the system and iterating on each one after receiving feedback from our sponsors. Once we have developed a minimum viable product that the sponsors approve of, then we will move our focus to reaching our stretch goals, if possible, and then eventually finalizing the product.</p>
	<li>Required Tools and Techniques</li>
	<p>The system will be developed using C# and the sponsor’s OpenDevice API for the Event Generator and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Web Application. The system event generator, as well as any created services, need to be able to run on the OnGuard server (Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2016 and later). The Event Generator will also include an installer that is compatible with the outlined technologies previously mentioned.</p>
	<li>Internal Artifacts Maintained</li>
	<p>We will be using GitHub and GitHub Issue Tracker to maintain our artifacts, product backlog, and bugs.</p>
